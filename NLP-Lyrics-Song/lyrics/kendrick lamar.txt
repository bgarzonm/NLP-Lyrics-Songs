Kendrick Lamar Sing About Me Im Dying Of Thirst Lyrics
When the lights shut off and it's my turnTo settle down, my main concernPromise that you will sing about mePromise that you will sing about meI said when the lights shut off and it's my turnTo settle down, my main concernPromise that you will sing about mePromise that you will sing about meI woke up this morning and figured I'd call youIn case I'm not here tomorrowI'm hopin' that I can borrowA peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really importantMy mind is really distortedI find nothing but trouble in my lifeI'm fortunate you believe in a dreamThis orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routineAnd last night was just another distractionOr a reaction of what we consider madnessI know exactly what happenedYou ran outside when you heard my brother cry for helpHeld him like a newborn baby and made him feelLike everything was alright in a fight he tried to put upBut the type of bullet that stuckHad went against his will, that's blood spilled on your handsMy plan's rather vindictiveEverybody's a victim in my eyesWhen I ride it's a murderous rhythmAnd outside became pitch blackA demon glued to my back, whispering "Get 'em!"I got 'em and I ain't give a fuckThat same mentality I told my brother not to duckIn actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colorsI wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recoverThe life that I knew as a younginIn pajamas and dun-ta-dunsWhen thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumbNiggas like me never prosperPrognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devotedThis Piru shit been in me foreverSo forever I'ma push it, wherever, wheneverAnd I love you 'cause you love my brother like you didJust promise me you'll tell this story when you make it bigAnd if I die before your album drop, I hope—

Mass hallucination, babyIll education, babyWant to reconnect with your elations?This is your station, babyLook inside these walls and you see I'm havin' withdrawalsOf a prisoner on his wayTrapped inside your desire to fire bullets that strayTrack attire just tell you I'm tired and ran awayI should ask a choir: "What do you requireTo sing a song that acquire me to have faith?"As the record spin I should prayFor the record, I recognize that I'm easily preyI got ate alive yesterdayI got animosity buildin', it's prob'ly big as a buildin'Me jumpin' off of the roof is me just playin' it safeBut what am I 'posed to do when the topic is red or blueAnd you understand that I ain'tBut know I'm accustomed to just a couple that look for troubleAnd live in the street with rankNo better picture to paint than me walkin' from Bible studyAnd called his homies because he had said he noticed my faceFrom a function that tooken place, they was wonderin' if I bangStep on my neck and get blood on your Nike checksI don't mind 'cause one day you'll respectThe good kid, m.A.A.d city

Kendrick Lamar United In Grief Lyrics
I hope you find some peace of mind in this lifetimeI hope you find some paradiseI've been goin' through somethin'One-thousand eight-hundred and fifty-five daysI've been goin' through somethin'Be afraidWhat is a bitch in a miniskirt?A man in his feelings with bitter nerveWhat is a woman that really hurt?A demon, you're better off killing herWhat is a relative making repetitive narrativesOn how you did it first?That is a predator, hit reverseAll of your presidents' evil thirstWhat is a neighborhood rep'table?That is a snitch on a pedestalWhat is a house with a better view?A family broken in variablesWhat is a rapper with jewelry?A way that I show my maturityWhat if I call on security?That mean I'm calling on God for purityI went and got me a therapistI can debate on my theories and sharing it Consolidate all my comparisonsHumblin' up because time was imperative Started to feel like it's only one answerTo everything, I don't know where it is Popping a bottle of Claritin Is it my head or my arrogance? Shaking and moving, like, what am I doing?I'm flipping my time through the RolodexIndulging myself and my life and my musicThe world that I'm in is a cul-de-sacThe world that we in is just menacingThe demons portrayed as religionousI wake in the morning, another appointmentI hope the psychologist listenin'

I'm sensitive, I feel everything, I feel everybodyOne man standin' on two words, heal everybodyTransformation, then reciprocation, karma must returnHeal myself, secrets that I hide, buried in these wordsDeath threats, ego must die, but I let it purgePacify, broken pieces of me, it was all a blurMother cried, put they hands on her, it was family tiesI heard it all, I should've grabbed a gun, but I was only fiveI still feel it weighin' on my heart, my first tough decisionIn the shadows clingin' to my soul as my only criticWhere's my faith? Told you I was Christian, but just not todayI transformed, prayin' to the trees, God is taking shapeMy mother's mother followed me for years in her afterlifeStarin' at me on back of some buses, I wake up at nightLoved her dearly, traded in my tears for a Range RoverTransformation, you ain't felt grief 'til you felt it soberI wish I was somebodyAnybody but myselfOoh, I wish I was somebodyAnybody but myselfI remember lookin' in the mirror knowin' I was giftedOnly child, me for seven years, everything for ChristmasFamily ties, they accused my cousin, "Did he touch you, Kendrick?"Never lied, but no one believed me when I said "He didn't"Frozen moments, still holdin' on it, hard to trust myselfI started rhymin', copin' mechanisms to lift up myselfTalked to my lawyer, told me not to be so hard on myselfHe has an aura, I hope to achieve, if I find some helpCongratulations, made it to be famous, still I feel uneasyWater watchin', live my life in nature, only thing relieves meSpirit guide whisper in my ear, tell me that she sees me"Did he touch you?" I said "No" again, still they didn't believe meMother’s brother said he got revenge for my mother’s faceBlack and blue, the image of my queen that I can't erase'Til this day can't look her in the eyes, pain is takin' overBlame myself, you never felt guilt 'til you felt it sober

So I met this young lady, ya know, when I went back home. I was tryna spit my best game to her, you know, give her my best cap, but she kept on snapping her fingers like *snaps*. I said "You know what, girl? You crazy." Then she asked me what he said... "A peace of mind"That's what the Asian said—I need a divineIntervention was his religion and I was surprisedHim believing in Buddha, me believing in GodAsked him what are you doing, he said "taking my time"Meditation is a must, it don't hurt if you trySee you thinking too much, plus you too full of yourselfWorried about your career, you ever think of your health? "A piece of land"That's what the Indian said—I needed the manTelling me longevity is in the dirtShould buy some property firstShould profit a better dollar with generational perksEquity at his best, really, you should investThese tangible things expire, don't you expectIncome with so much outcome and yesLook at my heritage, we blessed "A piece of pussy"That's what the black man said I needed to push meTo the limit, to satisfy my hungerWe do it all for a woman from haircut to a warWe like to live in the jungle, like to play in the peachWhat you saying to me?He said "nigga, come back to reality for a week"Pussy is power, fuck on a new bitch every nightI wouldn't be prouder, you should allow it

Nigga, I hate it"So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, I hate it"Frustrated and I'm riding down them back streetsMaking my conscience ask me"Will I survive to make it up out this hole in time?"Black boy fly, black boy flyBlack, black boy fly, black boy flyI used to be jealous of Arron AfflaloI used to be jealous of Arron AfflaloHe was the one to followHe was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrowsHe would live in the gym, we was living in sorrowTotal envy of him, he made his dream become a realityActually making it possible to swimHis way up outta Compton with further more to accomplishGraduate with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholarsIt's 2004 and I'm watching him score thirtyRemember vividly how them victory points had hurt me'Cause every basket was a reaction or a reminderThat we was just moving backwardsThe bungalow where you find usThe art of us ditching classes, heading nowhere fastStick my head inside the study hall, he focused on mathDetermination ambition, plus dedication and wisdomQualities he was given was the shit we didn't haveDug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finalsHe had his back like a spinal, meanwhileWe singing the same old song spinning the vinylEleven graders gone wrongHe focused on the NBA, we focused on some PatronNow watch that black boy fly

I got you babyAll on you babyPush it back on daddyPush it back on daddy, babyI seen it vividly, jogging my brain memory, life no—I seen it vividly, jogging my brain memoryLife no longer infinity, this was the final callingNo birds chirping or flying, no dogs barkingWe all nervous and crying, moving in cautionIn disbeliefs our belief's the reason for all thisThe tallest building plummet, cracking, and crumblingThe ground is shaking, swallowing young womanWith a baby, daisies, and other flowers burning in destructionThe smell is disgusting, the heat is unbearablePreachers touching on boys run for cover, the paranoidRapists and murderers hurdle alleysValleys and high places turn into dustFamous screaming in agonyAtheists for suicide, planes falling out the skyTrains jumping off the track, mothers yelling "he's alive"Backpedaling Christians settling for forgivenessEvidence all around us the town is covered in fishesOcean water dried out, fire burning more tides outTabernacle and city capital turned inside outPublic bathroom, college classroom's been desertedAnother trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it no more running from world wars no more discriminating the poor no more bad bitches and real niggasWishing for green and gold the last taste of allureI swore I seen it vividlyA moniker of war from heaven that play the symphonyThunder like number four, then I heard"What have you did for me"I fell to my knees, pulled out my resumeThat dated back to June 17th, 1987My paperwork was like a receiptI was valedictorian, I was fearful of judgmentBut confident I had glory in all my past endeavorsClose my eyes, pray to God that I live foreverDark skies, fire and brimstone, some of us sent homeSome of us never did wrong but still went to hellGeez Louise, I thought you said that I excelI made To Pimp a Butterfly for youTold me to use my vocals to save mankind for youSay I didn't try for you, say I didn't ride for youI tithed for you, I pushed the club to the side for youWho love you like I love you?Crucifix, tell me you can fixAnytime I need, I'ma start jotting everything in my diaryNever would you lie to meAlways camaraderie, I can see, our days been numberedRevelation greatest as we hearing the last trumpetAll man, child, woman, life completely went in reverseI guess I'm running in place trying to make it to church

Kendrick Lamar Untitled 08 09062014 Lyrics
Why so sad?Walking around with them blue facesShe said I’m down on my luckAnd it’s something I gotta haveBlue facesI hit the bank today and told them color me badBlue facesGet that new money, and it’s breaking me down honeyTwo tears in the bucket I cry with you, uhBut I could never lie with youI could never afford not to affordI could never put my plans to the side with youI could never see a red lightLike a deer with a headlightI freeze up when I re-upSee I barely have patienceAnd you're relatingOnly the moment to complete usWhy you hate to work for it?The reason I never went to work for itSee a nine to five was so jive turkeyBut when Thanksgiving came that check didn’t hurt meYou plead the fifthI read the Fifth AmendmentWe both criminals with bad intentionsThey say time heals allBut if I can shortcutMy success, Corvettes by tomorrowWait a minute!

Kendrick Lamar Growing Apart To Get Closer Lyrics
Where are we going? Why are we slowing down?Where are you going? We should be growing nowWhere are we going? Why are we slowing down?Where are you going? We should be growing nowThat’s what she said to me, that place I used to call homeIs just a bed to meAnd we don’t even sleep, neighbors can hear her weepMeanwhile I’m in these streets with everybody, I’m trying to get itAnd she know they got me, I watch her feelings watch meAs they staring with the saddest eyes of lonelinessLook each other in the face and barely blinkI tried to make it right, but the pen ran out of inkSo if my letters don’t reach you, I hope these lyrics in syncWhere are we going? Why are we slowing down?Where are you going? We should be growing nowThat’s what it said to meBut the place I call ambition now dead to meGone and forgotten, I’m off track like Dale EarnhardtMy liver rotten, alcoholic trippingFucking bad bitches and they got bad intentionsClub night, guys and dollsBalling out but I'm 'bout to drop the ballI’m calling out for help, my engineer calledTold me come to the studio, I wanna tell him, nah

Kendrick Lamar Crown Lyrics
You walk around like everything is in controlFavor come with favors and you can't say noGo out the way to make the coin availableThat's what I call loveThe closest ones afraid to say they need some timeThe turnaround is life or death, but you don't mindGo out the way to say you made the compromiseThat's what I call loveBut the time it'll come to not be there when somebody needs youYou say no and all you've done gives them amnesiaOne thing I've learned, love can change with thе seasonsAnd I can't please еverybodyNo, I can't please everybodyWait, you can't please everybodyNo, I can't please everybodyI can't please everybodyThey idolize and praise your name across the nationTap the feet and nod the head for confirmationPromise that you keep the music in rotationThat's what I call love 

Kendrick Lamar Untitled 2 Blue Faces Lyrics
Two tears in a bucket, I cry with you, agh!But I could never lie with youI could never afford not to affordI could never put my plans to the side with youI could never see a red lightLike a deer with a headlight, I freeze up when I re-upSee, I barely have patience, and you're relatingOnly the moment to complete usWhy you hate to work for it? Went to work for itSee, a nine-to-five was so jive turkeyBut when Thanksgiving came, checks didn’t hurt meYou plead the fifth, I read the fifth amendmentWe both criminals with bad intentionsThey say time heals all, but if I can shortcut my successCorvettes by tomorrow, ugh!Why so sad? Walking around with them blue facesShe said I’m down on my luckAnd it’s something I gotta have, blue facesI hit the bank today and tell 'em color me bad, blue facesGet that new money, and it’s breaking me downMy homegirl got a credit card scamShe got a scholarship to college but she don’t give a damnIntuition got a Black woman wishin'She saying this on the phone with the noodles in the panI know you, woman, I console you, womanYou feel like the universe owes you, womanOh, the anticipation, hoping you could make itWomen don't prosper chasin' educationBut you're talented, and can't handle itAnd your homegirls can't be your manager365 times four, plus moreCan't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?But ain't no money like fast moneyEven today, I'm considered a crash dummyA rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?My accolades better than all them

A young nigga from ComptonOn the curb writing raps next to a gunshotOn the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwellThe fraudulent tender scars that get unveiledEveryone I knew was either Crip or PiruCousins in elementary, relatives in high schoolWith that being said, each one of their rivalsWas aiming something at my head, I needed survivalGot jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot backAnd I don't even push a line, I'm just tryna push these rhymesIn the midst of staying neutral and discreteMy momma said you're judged by the company you keepBut what you can consider, that if it goes downThey'll kill you if you kill me, it gets deep niggaSo if you ask what I'm doingI'm tryna duck the influence of my city that's brewing, real talk, andThis is why they fuck with me This is why they fuck with me I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

Kendrick Lamar Faith Lyrics
I take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunkI ain't a drinker, I'm a thinker, call it what you wantBut if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chanceTo witness the realest shit that's ever been told to manI found myself losing focus at a Sunday serviceEmbarrassed so I start questioning God, "What is my purpose?"He said to live the way he did, that's all he want from meSpread the word and witness, he rose on the first SundayI said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listenI opened my Bible in search to be a better ChristianAnd this from a person that never believed in religionBut shit, my life is so fucked up, man; I can't help but give inI'm giving testimonies to strangers I never metHopped on the pulpit and told them how I was truly blessedFelt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was overWalked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murderedThen lost my faith againWhat am I gonna doGotta have faithLife is too muchI'm just throughWhere is your faith?FaithAll you need is the size of a mustard seed

Kendrick Lamar Prayer Lyrics
I was born on February 24th, 1970The day I was delivered, they said I would build a legacyPicture me with influence that last generationsI was made out of love to keep you happy and educatedThe first three letters of the alphabet my nameI made you laugh, I made you dance, I made you singI been around the world and back, you recorded my almanacSo dearly way before the fact me and pops was estrangedMy father was a public figure, bigger than lifeLived as a winner, on stages alikeRivers of people surely united, just to see our bondTime carried on, that was a common threadMy perfect father had many flawsStill they moved they legs and shook they heads in unisonHe had more children, I was the oldestWe always played with each other 'fore they ruined 'emHe told me his personal secrets, childhood catching on beatingsSexually touched and abused, never seen life in a schoolThe price of being iconic was demonic and screwedI stood on stage and had to watch my father on the newsStress on the head of my spirit, I was lost and confusedI knew both sides of the story, but still, I couldn't chooseSee, it was more than humiliation and bein' suedThey crucified my affiliation for points to proveAnd now my purpose for livin' makes no difference to youMy total existence was for makin' a smiling moveThey said that I'll live foreverBut the moment he died, more accusations arrivedI had to die too

Why couldn't he throw a punch?And for our community do you know what this does?Add to a trail of hatred2012 was taped for the world to seeSet us back another 400 yearsThis is modern day slaveryThe reason why I'm by your houseYou threw your briefcase all on the couchI plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing outEvery piece of your brain'Til your son jumped in your armCut off the engine then sped off in the rainI'm on the dash with my bible in the trunkHad the vodka on the topHow come I can long timeHow come I could make it popular?Puff on what I wantHow come I could make it popular?Puff on what I wantSee I'm living with anxietyGiving up sobrietyCussing with his sisterAnd playing with societyJustice ain't freeTherefore justice ain't meTry and justify staying, obituaryWhy you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?Once upon a time, I go to church and talk to GodNow I'm thinking to myselfHollow tips is all I gotNow I'm drinking by myselfAt the end of Section ParkCaught you when you walk besides your houseYou threw your briefcase all on the couchI plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing outEvery piece of your brain'Til your spine drip to your armCut off the engine then sped off in a wraithI said Hiiipower, one time you see itHiiipower, two times, you see itHiiipower, two times you see itConversation for the entire nation this is bigger than us

Kendrick Lamar Another Nigga To Pimp A Butterfly Annotated
I remember you was conflictedMisusing your influenceSometimes I did the sameAbusing my power, full of resentmentResentment that turned into a deep depressionFound myself screaming in the hotel roomI didn’t wanna self destructThe evils of Lucy was all around meSo I went running for answersUntil I came homeBut that didn’t stop survivor’s guiltGoing back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earnedOr maybe how A-1 my foundation wasBut while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new oneA war that was based on apartheid and discriminationMade me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learnedThe word was respectJust because you wore a different gang color than mine'sDoesn’t mean I can’t respect you as a black manForgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streetsIf I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing usBut I don’t know, I’m no mortal man, maybe I’m just another nigga

Kendrick Lamar Rotc Interlude Lyrics
This is me thinking at 4:43 AM, June 6thSometimes I wanna say fuck rapping, I need money nowLike should I start trapping?If what I write down don't collect this very momentThen I'm on it, no questionIn the streets, my niggas is well connected, let's seeDo I cop a pound of kush, promethazine or push some E?Oxycontin have me laying on soft cotton when I sleep?This is deep as the abyss, I'm not just rhyming on the beatI be in spots, chopping the rocks like Flintstone feetThis is me, frustrated, battling my own evilsFinna saddle up that work across Ohio in a GeoOr should I sell my music .zip to buy your zipAnd hope one day it flourish to a kiloTrack record of a hustlerRather records on the needle, making musicClocking fast bank like a shot from Patrick EwingMy nigga, what you doing on these corners whipping?"I thought you had a show?" Well, my nigga, I guess I didn'tI'm tryna get this dough, and easy money sounds temptingEspecially when your homies pushing V8 enginesTwenty-two on twenty-sixes, Range Rovers rolling upThree-fifty for an ounce of fire, I hope I got enoughThis industry calling my bluff, I need a new solutionCurb-serving, or I might be in your store boostingTwo-elevens with Mac-11s like fuck hip-hopDon't wanna be Pun, don't wanna be B.I.G., don't wanna be PacJust give me your funds, A.K.A. everything that you gotOr everything getting shot, for nothingLeave you in shock, coughing up blood and mumblingWatch, the plans of a young man sponsorMoving grams like relocating your mom's mommaThen expand to the Hoover Dam, water, shermContraband, they yearn for the butt-nakedFuck a verse, verses get let off in thirty minutes, six secondsI disperse to the world of unruly, where I put the mic downAnd pick up a sack and a toolie, if you knew meYou'll know I always had a passion for riddling, writingBut lately, I've been thinking 'bout taking chances to brightenMy future financially, so please don't be mad at meI gotta do what I gotta do, no shitSo I tell my nigga, "Front me, let me put it on the strip"Then give it back when I think about the consequenceShit...

Kendrick Lamar Dreams Lyrics
Nah, what you get outta, outta not writing your stuff down on paper, you get the more-you know the...expression, the feeling yourself. You know what you want to say; instead of reading a paper that sounds read, it sounds narrated. Unless you wanna do it narrated...What if a dream was reality and reality was a dream?And as complicated as it seems, if things we imagined actually happened?And real life situations was artificialThey say we only living to dieImagine if we're already dead, waiting to live, living in hellTrying to cross over to heaven we're confusing ourselvesPlanet earth's like Oceans 11, we're plottin' for the getawayWhen my childhood friends get sent away to prison on their first offenseIt's fucked up but listen, we study God but don't know himCriticize people that work on Sundays, two jobs just to feed their kidsWell, momma's scratching lottery tickets knowing that it's just a fairy taleCus' we ain't gonna winEvery time that she's bubblin' in, it feels like the devil's holding a penDon't mind me I'm just thinking againThinking out loud, thinking the opposite of proudCus' I'm disappointed at my self sometimesSelf-esteem gets lower than night strippersHard to motivate the right rhymes, inspired by true crimesIt's not a game, it's nothing to play withTurn it off then come back the next day, it's here to stayStruggle that isI'm so infatuated with knowing something that's waiting after this lifeThat means what I'm thinking is rightPunch, loop the beat for a minuteMoment of silence for J. Dilla, he on his way homeKnow he see me spillin' my heart, hope for it soonWait a minute K. Dot! you said turn it back on, bring it backIf dreams was realityIf it was cool for you to be a casualtyThe only way that you can escape povertySay that I'm weird but obviously you didn't get it when I said it the first timeYou're listening too far if you hear this partI suggest you go back and press rewindI fast forward to common thoughts of a humanDeep in my thoughts like Patrick Ewing in the paintLook what I brought to my state that they can't bring - the industry need a fixStick heroin needles inside politics, this is crack musicO-pi-um, inside the veins of them, I don't abuse itCapture each moment like film, photo-shooting all my enemies movingDirect them to a casketGive it to 'em only if they ask for it, if they want...If they wanna see reality I'm losing you again ain't I?Ain't I, the perfect candidate to represent the fifty states?Black President, they don't wanna see thatIt's evident...pain is painWe only love to hate each other that's striving for great-nessI swear to God that we live in a MatrixTake that blue pill then we start seeing spaceshipsKanye, west-coast niggas do it the bestBring each other down, crab in a bucket effectWe learn to live with it I guessI mean die with it, since we're already deadTrying to cross over to heaven, that's what I said the first timeGet it? Now little boy I gotta sit you downTeach you about the things that we live aroundMaterialistic things that we buyin' now means nothing later when the dream kick inFade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out...

Kendrick Lamar Alright Music Video Lyrics

Kendrick Lamar Vanity Slaves Lyrics
Sometimes I want to leave, sometimes I want to crySometimes I hate to bear the truth, sometimes I want to lieSometimes I want to school the youth, sometimes I want to rideSometimes I want to not think, sometimes I want to vibeSometimes I want to bump Tribe and zone outThis song's 'bout a young boy that's gone wild insideWhen my world collideWith your world where your girl and your kids resideWe killed the facades, we feel free to flyWe're birds that reserve in the charismatic skyI care about my pride too muchIf my clothes is new, if my ride is plushIf my hair is cut, if my diamonds is crushedI look in the mirror, I'm trendy enough? WrongInsecurity roams the black communityHomes where kids must have jewelryThe high school female need earrings and detailsSo she can be cool to be, amongst popularityThe various name brands that reached the price scanIt's not about the right price but more like the right scamTo rule us all, confuse us allHit the bank within five minutes and then withdrawNow let's drawThe picture of a rapper with a chain and Range that is not paid forMy cousin from the South said he just bought him a houseThat lives around his neck like a white collarSo why fast forward? then I'll rewind, a time machine can help me double back to slavery timesPicking cotton from a field that a white man ownThe blacker you are, farther you're from the white man's homeNegro spiritual songs, gave us some type of sanityBefore your vanity, they parted our familiesThey put us in hundred degree shade and outside we bathedThe more we were afraid, the more they made rulesAnd trapped our minds in a cage, our freedom was so vagueCouldn't see it with the eyes of Tracee Ross And school was exempt, see we couldn't have smartsAnd a smirk could get you hurt, wounded first from a scar400 years of nothing, 400 years of suffering400 years of tears, and tribulations, miseducationSee what we facing is now coming back to the rootsRemember whips on our back and if we would run they would shootCalled us niggers and figured that we never live in pursuitOf happiness, we capture these feelings in things that we doThought of abstinence of slavery but we made it come toAbout a perspective, my shoe selection gotta be LouieHer hand bag gotta be Gucci, it's fake then she fool meShe still bad though, and her fake Gucci ain't that bad thoughWe filling up the gas for RolliesUpgrade to 26's after riding KobesMy cousin from the South, slavery start in the South and I bet yaHe overcompensates for the life of his ancestorsSo blame it on the 400 years we never sawThe reason why the next 400 we gotta flossSlaves

I can tell you what it is, I can tell you what it isn'tNo more K. Dot, my mother had named me KendrickFuck a stage name, that's the name that I was givenThe only thing that I can identify within this businessI'm just a good kid from Compton that want to rapWeighing my options, pick up a Bible or a strap?I never killed a man, never sold any crackAll I ever did was try to keep my city on the mapBut this monkey on my back, y'all don't want me to winI'm tryna follow dreams, you want me to follow trendsSo just to get a dollar, will I sell my soul?I look the Devil in the eye and tell him, "Hell no"They say anything worth having is worth the waitWell, I want the world, tell me how long that takesThere's no time like now, I can cut my patience shortOr give 'em some more gowns, I don't even want the crownI just want a peace of mind, and nigga, when I get itYou won't get a piece of mine, won't you mind your own business?A rich nigga buy anything you sell himA broke nigga believe anything that you tell himWell I'm a broke nigga, but still I wouldn't listen to youEven if your hand was on a Bible quote, nigga, pfttuhSee I was brought up differentWhatever that my pops said, for sure I'd listenYou said you did dirt, but I can't dig itIt don't concern you if you wasn't born in itOh-no-oh-ohI swear we got to fast-forward, before time flies byMy new saying for '0-10 is, why lie?And if you ain't trying to win, then why try?Now you can low-ball or give me high fiveThis is I nigga, look into my eye

Kendrick Lamar War Is My Love Lyrics
Look inside my eyes and tell me you see a warriorI never felt the feeling of euphoriaPain forever or prolong the pros and cons of prosperity is strongWake up in the morning and I gotta winNot taking the victory, that's my only sinAnd so I send a message to your messengerA warning shot to let em know I'm seriousI'm ready for a war, when I roar it can break a glass windowThe only thing for sure: the perfect way to bend youOn your back even if I gotta slither through the cracksI can crack every code you deliver, I attackEvery hole where the bomb squad sit it on the tripodEven if you try hard, he can still die hardRun but you can't hide: white flagsYou can pull em out fast and tell me your last goodbyeI will, I will climb the highest mountainBefore the flood comesAnd all my fight is drowning in bloodWhat I got to lose? What I got to prove?I guess war is my loveMake sure your next move is slick, your best move is nothingYou know I take risk: dark clouds, I love itCause I can hide in the mist, hop outAnd crush every soldier you're with, so I'm 6 for 6I'm sick with determination: I'll terminate ya quickI lead the pack, I follow no rulesI see the traps, I know you're close toFalling on your face, unload, reloadHand me another case, explode, explodeThe fire of my eyes is waiting on your demiseI know you hope your help is close by

Kendrick Lamar Wanna Be Heard Lyrics
It's like I don't think you fully understand who I am, ya know?I'm just a good kid from Compton that wanna rapI don't represent no colors, I represent my lil' sisters and brothersI'm the oldest, niggaAnd if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wackCheck it outI used to wanna rap like JAY-ZUntil I finally realized that Jay wasn't meI took my time to jot down every line that's a quotableCritics say I don't be killing this shit but I know I doBecause I used to practice early morning and then after schoolI'm working on my hooks my nigga, I ain't tryna battle youBut even if I did, I guarantee I'd overshadow youLike a fucked up taper that turned to bowl cutI'mma close cut to Common and Gucci ManeNow that's a comparison that you probably wouldn't understandBecause I can touch the people and still keep it ghettoAs an '87 Regal with the tree air freshener on the rearview mirrorI wear a heart on my shoulder'Member when we used to make the boost look like Motorola?Your cousin fucked up your room every time he came overThen went to jail when we got olderThat shit is a bad odor, but still I remain focusedIn due time, I'll be able to swipe my card and it won't say declineThat shit's embarrassing huhHope no one pay you no mindBut it's a bad bitch behind you while you standing in lineCan you relate to my story? Can you follow my dreamsAnd admirations that I had ever since I was thirteen?My momma believed in me, she let me use her van to go to the studioEven though she know her tank is empty, that's who I do it fo'My pops got a different approach, yeah he believedBut he always questioned when I'mma drop my debut CDHow long this gon' take nigga? You still haven't ate niggaAt twenty-two I had two cars and my own place niggaIt's a sacrifice I try to tell himThat's when he turn to BET and tell me that he jealousOf all these niggas getting money and their shit don't sound like shitI ain't tryna kill your confidence or forcing you to quitI just wanna hear you heard

Kendrick Lamar Funkmaster Flex Freestyle Lyrics
Heard a conversation with my father talking to his favorite partnerAt the domino table, Tony had told him that he saw aYoung nigga hopping out busting like four chartersPopping pills, mix a gallon of sherm and some holy waterMix a gallon of sherm and some holy waterSell it to a priest he probably can get it off by tomorrowIt's wicked when my favorite uncle kick itFiends trying to kick the addiction of sucking glass dicksVivid images go against any fantasy you can fathomPhantoms ain't the only thing that suicidalOpen the doorway to his soulHit the hallway then hit the closet you see a rifleAim it at your arteries, pardon me, parts of me is pyschoIn retrospect my respect was a power ranger high noteTumbling backwards into a karate kicking high noteMy innocence would eventually see a hindranceSurrenduring Ninja Turtles, pizza and Sega GenesisHeard it over my bunk bed ear hustlingSomething my papa said that caught my attentionHis eyes red he's smoking on marijuana mixing the two elevenHe said I'm seven going on sixty-sevenThe day I turned seventeen is the day that a lesson inside my lifetimeCome across a clothes line, every stick is a co-signEverything in the streets got the power to make me go blindEven if he sat me down in the sun and gave me those eyesComprehend it well and I could smell the soberness evaporating by itselfHe said, "Tony my biggest fear is to hear Kendrick disappeared in the fire out here and I didn't helpSo if I can give him the game to hydroplane his decisions in life so he can goFurther than the streets and remain to be on the honor roll"Sacrifice my life even if that shit, my mama thoughTil the day he carried by the big six, domino

Kendrick Lamar Determined Lyrics
I want to describe my discovery in the simplest terms possibleBecause it will reveal to you why it is trueThat’s whatever the mind can deceive and believeThe mind can achieveRegardless of how many times you may have failed in the pastOr off day your aims and hopes may beGo getter, with no cheddarJust a white tee and a swap meet sweaterMy life is likely to see great endeavorsBut I can't win if I can't get it togetherWhat I gotta do in order to see success?Having the world's best to call me the best?Pull up at the Grammy awards as the best dressedWith an address linked to a beautiful actress?A dollar and a dream, I feel J. ColeWord to the hole in my pocket and the hoesThat don't wanna fuck with a broke nigga with ambitionBut the last time I checked, y'all was broke bitchesMake a name for myself then bubble like the ass of BuffyWhen she wearing a tight beltThe homies on the block can say whatever they sayI don't wanna be a killer, I wanna be a Gates

I am a sinner who’s probably gonna sin againLord forgive me, Lord forgive meThings I don’t understandSometimes I need to be aloneBitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibeI can feel your energy from two planets awayI got my drink, I got my musicI would share it but today I’m yellingBitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibeBitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibeLook inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get richLook inside of your soul and you can find out it never existI can feel the changes, I can feel a new lifeI always knew life can be dangerousI can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painlessYou don’t know what pain isHow can I paint this picture when the color blind is hanging with youFell on my face and I woke with a scarAnother mistake living deep in my heartWear it on top of my sleeve in a flickI can admit that it did look like yoursWhy you resent every making of thisTell me your purpose is petty againBut even a small lighter can burn a bridgeEven a small lighter can burn a bridge

Ali, mix itHa ha ha, Lady G, Whaddup?Ha ha ha, Bad Love, Whaddup?Ha ha ha, ha...I spaz out 'til I pass outThere’s clarity in my vulgarity for a sass-mouthYour parody’s not funnyApparently you ain't nothing but industry crash dummiesAs long as the lord love me, I’m goodI could: be the best rapper but I’d rather be the answer that capture the violence that coincides in my hoodI should: stick a fork in this music businessBut I’m too deep in it like pussy on my penisDevil’s kitchen in Phoenix; that’s the heat that I’m bringing where the shade at?I’m L.A. radio and good music, boy, I don’t play thatUgh, Walking a thin line from thinking like EinsteinAnd rhyming like Rakim in ’89Don’t wanna pack a nine just a mind full of wisdomLike a man 99 years old locked in prisonDon’t freeload on my visionGet exposed like an R&B ho with a sex tape hiddenI’m always for the business, forever you can feel itWhether you Crip blue or a nigga that hemorrhageMy penmanship is like me and Langston combined to the hipAnd my hip to the hop don’t stop as I rockI got a buzz like a shot of Palmer SunAnd the women fall in love as they fall in my crotchNow understand that I’m all that you’ve gotGive me chance, give me ears, give me hearts, give me propsHear the difference? I’m cool like thatOh, you spit? Well the retarded drool is backSee, I’m the author of the authors, the father of the Austin Power fajjaWho can bust like a charter, why bother?I know a jealous serpent is a burden to my lifeBut still I carry on like luggage on a flightThe realness in my bones is the DNA to lifeI can give you insight only if you’re in sightI’m looking past y’all like a fastball - strike!And I ain't even tryna give it my all - yikes!I’m comfortable enough to go and chill out with a HuxtableYou couldn’t see my pedestal, because you’re afraid of heightsCloud 9, where you can findMe in my dime like Roosevelt in his primeWait 'til I’m in my primeThe moon and the stars will align on my Louis V. belt like OrionTo whom say he cool: but the irony is I could hold the bottom of an iron with the bottom of my palmI say so much, so little all action, no talk like a mime throwing up gang signsIt’s not all about punchlines, I don’t do thatI’m a Jaguar; you’re just a new cat, now move backKendrick Lamar on the radar for successAiming for the top like an AR aimed at your neckI can never digress, ‘less I get demoted to deathEven then I’ll be the best still, like a petty theftI will: conquer my biggest dreamsOnce you open the cage, I bet that I’ll spread my wingsNipsy got street cred, Jay Rock got street credAnd all I got is bad credit, big ears and big headBut still they’ll feel me, cause we all ate cerealHumped our momma's friend's daughter while they bump the stereoBackflips on shopping carts, free lunch at the parkWatched Power Rangers after school; here we goI’m so Comptonized, I will never compromiseFor no faulty ass A&R or CEOWe ain't what you think and you think we’re backBut we’ve been here for decades, and I vouch for thatOpen your mouth for that, speak well like a great debater over iChatGet your other eye crackedI don’t rap, I-Iraq and declare warI enjoy watching enemies' blood pourI came up lower middle class, not poorSo don’t feel sorry for me, I don’t need y’all to love meI need y’all to feel meAnd if you feeling froggy to leap, then feel freeMy feeling’s all aside, my pride is deprivedBy the ultimate prize I'mma get when I see your suicide

Kendrick Lamar Kendrick Lamar Rapper Of The Year Gq Annotated
Reminder that you can click the images for more annotations.Every member of rap's Mount Rushmore dropped new albums in 2013—Kanye, Jay Z, Drake, Eminem—but it was another MC altogether who stole the crown, and he did it with just a handful of verses: Kendrick Lamar, the latest—and possibly greatest—rapper to come straight outta Compton.We are 10,000 feet above Compton in a private jet, and Kendrick Lamar is explaining to me what happened to him yesterday, when he vanished. We had a plan: Kendrick was going to give me a guided, cue-the-G-funk-synth Star Maps tour of his neighborhood, the one he still more or less lives in, starting at his parents' house a couple of blocks from his old high school, Centennial High, near the corner of Piru and South Central. Instead, he went AWOL. The whole day, no one from his label, Interscope, or Top Dawg Entertainment, the baby Death Row Records that originally signed him, could track him down. Kendrick was gone.It turned out he was sitting shivah for a murdered friend he calls his "little bro"—a kid from a neighborhood where friendship is defined primarily by neighborhood. A few weeks earlier, Chad Keaton, 23, had been wounded in a drive-by shooting very close to Kendrick's parents' house. He held on for a month but ultimately died of complications from the gunshot wounds.So today, here on board this Challenger 300 seven-seater, en route to New York City's fall Fashion Week, a destination filled with people Kendrick isn't sure whether he wants to impress or fuck with, he's telling me about Chad. "It all happened when I was overseas," he says. "I had to talk to him over Skype on the hospital bed before he passed."It's been a strange year. When it began, Kendrick was already regarded as something of a messiah among rap nerds—one of the best rappers ever to come out of the place that has produced many of the best rappers ever—and since then his legend has spread fast.It actually began late last year, when Kendrick's major-label-debut album, good kid, m.A.A.d city,dropped, to universal acclaim. The album—about a day in the life of nerdy Compton teenager K.Dot and his homeys as they run around in his mom's minivan chasing "that crazy-ass girl Sherane"—is practically a black Ulysses: a portrait of the rapper as a young man, simultaneously a drive-by deconstruction of gangster rap's violent tropes and a celebration of its signature, slow-rolling sound. On good kid, Lamar is our embedded correspondent, spitting triple-time confessionals from a part of the country most of us had forgotten once the rap scene found a fresher inner city to fetishize. He's the game's most linguistically cerebral MC, but also its realest—the one who finds the most vivid way to tell a story about his unemployed buddies trying to rope him into robbing some dude's house—and it's this polarity that makes listening to King Kendrick feel like you're putting on the illest 3-D glasses in hip-hop. The music nods at influences far beyond the West Coast—Beach House samples, Dungeon Family lushness—but throughout, his voice stays singularly focused on a twenty-block radius around Central Avenue and Piru Street:If Pirus and Crips all got along They'd probably gun me down by the end of this songGood kid, m.A.A.d city sold an industry-shocking 241,000 copies its first week and went platinum this summer. Then, in August, Kendrick snuck a sixty-four-bar Trojan horse into his buddy Big Sean's song "Control"—a guest spot on a song that didn't even make the final record. After Big Sean goes on for a while about drinking champagne in Detroit, Kendrick wakes up the entire hip-hop universe, calling out nearly every single young rapper in the game: Drake; A$AP Rocky; J. Cole; Tyler, the Creator; even Big Sean himself. The dude slaps Sean on his own song. He also proclaimed himself "the king of New York," which to certain East Coast ears sounded like a Greek dude strolling into Troy and dropping a deuce on the tomb of Hector."Control" leaked on YouTube late in the day on August 12; for a solid week, it was the biggest story in music. Just a few weeks after that, Kanye announced he was touring solo for the first time in five years and that his opening act would be Kendrick Lamar.Kendrick's career momentum has created a dissonance that must look surreal from 30,000 feet. Chad Keaton's memorial service was held just before Labor Day weekend; Kendrick attended, then flew straight to a show in Alaska. Next it was on to Vegas to perform at a pool party. He only made it "back to the set" to grieve for a single day, the day we were scheduled to talk. "It can be complicated and confusing," Kendrick says of his life right now, funerals for murdered friends one day, private jets to fashion parties the next. "From my perspective, it's not just I'm famous—I still live in this world." And when someone back home needs something, "I still gotta get that phone call."It's clear the emotions are still raw. Kendrick is a small guy, just five feet six, and with his black hood pulled up over his head, a chain around the outside of his sweatshirt, it felt like I was talking to a wizened rap Jedi. After about an hour of questions, I gave him a break, and he lay down on the couch to rest. Just kind of curled up with his back turned.A bit later, I saw a tweet from him to his 2.4 million followers pop up on my phone: "When the cameras stop rolling, it doesn't mean real life will follow." Instantly it had fifty-six retweets. After one minute, 600. After two minutes, 1,000. Then he tweeted a picture of Chad: "Rest N Heaven my Lil bro. Watched u become a man. U fought bro. The city stole yo life, but not your legacy."On the night of the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, just as the heat over "Control" was peaking, I tailed Kendrick through the backstage maze at Brooklyn's Barclays Center. At one point, he ran into Drake, and they wrapped each other up in a big hug. It was their first encounter since Kendrick called him out on "Control," and of all the slaps in that verse, this one felt the most personal, because Drake had helped break Kendrick, handing the kid not just a verse but an entire song on his second album. After Drake's VMA performance of "Hold On, We're Going Home," Kendrick made his way back to the greenroom, crooning the hook: I got my eyes on you.... He caught mine and smiled. "You watch," he joked, "I'm going to be singing by my fifth album!"I asked if this meant things were cool between him and Drake. He paused. "Pretty cool." Shrugs. "And I mean, I would be okay if we weren't."A month later, it became apparent that things between Kendrick and Drake were definitely not cool. After Drake's new album dropped, he gave a pair of interviews in which he sounded wounded by the "Control" thing: "You can't just say that and then see me and be like, 'Yeah, man, what's up?'—pretending like nothing ever happened." Seemingly in response, during the BET Hip-Hop Awards cypher a few weeks later, Kendrick freestyled: Nothing been the same since they dropped "Control" / and tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes.I got Kendrick on the phone after the BET taping, and he admitted to being surprised by Drizzy's public lash-out—"Control" named names, sure, but at its core it was a backhanded tribute to the peers Kendrick actually gives a shit about. Most of them took it in that spirit. Not Drake. "Yeah, I guess he took it as a dis," Kendrick said, downplaying talk of a beef. But he was also clear that he doesn't look up to Drake, doesn't see him as any kind of creative influence. When I asked if Drake was a mentor or a role model, he replied quickly, "No—peer. If anything. We all peers."When Kendrick Lamar was 21, 2Pac appeared to him in a vision. Before you roll your eyes, Lamar wants you to know that he's not the hermit-on-the-edge-of-the-Nitrian-Desert, vision-seeing type. He knows how this sounds."I was coming from a late studio session, sleeping on Mom's couch. I'm 26 now—it wasn't that long ago. I remember being tired, tripping from the studio, lying down, and falling into a deep sleep and seeing a vision of Pac talking to me. Weirdest shit ever. I'm not huge on superstition and all that shit. That's what made it so crazy. It can make you go nuts. Hearing somebody that you looked up to for years saying, 'Don't let the music die.' Hearing it clear as day. Clear as day. Like he's right there. Just a silhouette."The visit from Pac changed Kendrick's connection to the world he was chronicling in his music and compelled him to think more carefully about who was listening to it. "It wasn't just about money, hoes, clothes, drinkin'," he explains. "I mean, I come from that world, but at the same time, I started to realize that there's people out there that can't really connect to that lifestyle. They're in the struggle."Much of Kendrick's music now is an attempt to transcend his ravaged world without separating himself from it in judgment, about somehow gaining control over his household's chaos—some of his uncles were Crips, and his father was reportedly a Gangster Disciple in Chicago before moving to Compton—and over his neighborhood's warped commitment to adolescent pride. It's an ethos that extends to his crew. They have a seriousness of purpose, a rigorous discipline that can feel slightly monastic at times. Kendrick doesn't smoke weed or drink booze. In the time I spent with him, I never witnessed anyone roll even the thinnest spider leg of a jay, nor did I see Kendrick so much as glance at the many, many girls around him. "When I ask OGs why there's so much division in the streets—nobody never really knows," he says. "But you know one thing that everybody always mention? A woman."A few hours after the VMAs, we were back in Kendrick's hotel room and everybody was in a lull, staring at cell phones, waiting for news about afterparties. A plan coalesced to hit a party being thrown by Diddy at the Dream Downtown hotel. But one of Kendrick's Top Dawg boys leaned back and said, "Aw, man, I can't go to no club."Kendrick spoke up."We have to go.""Look at you! We have to go. You're never we have to go.""You know me," Kendrick explained. "I only go when there's a point. Usually the point is just niggas drinking. But walking through the club the week after I released the 'Control' verse? That's a point!"Twenty minutes later, Anthony "Top Dawg" Tiffith, basically TDE's Suge Knight, asked if I had had a fun day. I said that I had and that I was surprised by their discipline. "You guys seem so calm," I said."Well," Tiffith told me, "we're going to have to call it a night with you, because we about to get uncalm. You understand."The gossip from Diddy's Ciroc Amaretto Launch Party/VMA Afterparty sounded like it fell out of a massive tear in the mid-'90s West Coast-East Coast time wave. Bloggers breathlessly recounted a surreal scene at Dream: booths packed with hip-hop illuminati—Jay, Bey—mouths agape as a wasted Diddy, incensed by the "King of New York" boast, attempted to pour a drink  over Kendrick's head, only to be thwarted by Jay Z acolyte J. Cole, who was kicked out in the ensuing chaos. Naturally Kendrick himself refused to corroborate any of this. "It was all love at that party," he told me on the private jet.After we land at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, I catch a ride with Kendrick into Manhattan. His show tonight is a New York Fashion Week kickoff party in Chelsea thrown by industry doyenne Jenné Lombardo, and in the car he goofs around, imagining the horror he and his Compton homeys could inspire: "We invited Kendrick Lamar, not K.Dot and them Piru niggas."By the end of his forty-minute set, the crowd is pretty fucked-up. There's chronic in the air; models are tottering in their heels. When Kendrick launches into the call-and-response for "Swimming Pools ," a song about his family's dark relationship with chemical dependency—Head shot. DRANK. Sit down. DRANK. Stand up. DRANK—a wraithlike six-foot blonde with a white veil dances around a little coven of models. There is something demonic about the scene: Kendrick recounting his fever dreams about the grim consequences of decadence while presiding over a decadent Fashion Week party.It's hard to guess how scenes like this will change Kendrick and his music. Sometime in January, he will step into Top Dawg's booth again, and he expects to be just as surprised as the rest of us by what comes out. "I don't know," he says. "It depends on where my emotion is. How angry I'll be, or how happy I'll be, or how confused I'll be."At one point on good kid Kendrick raps, "I can feel the changes / I can feel a new life / I always knew life can be dangerous". The biggest change in Kendrick's life is the inversion of rap's consummate observer becoming the observed. How will all eyez on him affect his art? Because he's already 10,000 feet above Compton, and rising.

Kendrick Lamar Somebody Lyrics
I woke this mornin' undecidedMy demons takin' over my life, yeahSooner or later it's a family dividedThese patterns gettin' hard to hide, yeahThey say I should be satisfiedThey tell me I got the world, but that's a lieI wished the way I feel could be pacified, sometimesI wish I was somebodyAnybody but myselfOh, I wish I was somebodyAnybody but myselfIf I told you I'm 'bout to break would you look at me different?Character out of place, would I lose your attention?Let me know your intentions, cause lately I been watchin' everybodyIt's apparent that transparency never seen monotonyGot off of tour, lookin' for closureMixin' emotions of bein' grateful and feelin' like some of y'all gettin' overWhat's a puppet on stage, singin' and dancin' ablaze?But trading his worth, distorted by the money that's madeA slave with a verse, I feel like Prince RogersI feel liberation is free, I feel I should miss the OscarsAre you celebrating me as the artist or just a profit?A question I have for the ones around me that's turnin' toxicMy lungs been heavy from all the smokescreen boobytrapsReminiscin' on what it was, and knowin' that this ain't thatI vision a rock in a hard placeHope my daughter isn't born with a piece of my heartbreakYou know stress carries on and your kids reap the mistakes that you madeAnd I admit that I can be dismissive if I can't relateAnd I admit that I only commit to start playin' gamesAnd I admit that I'm bad at talkin' myself out of shameBut who's to blame when the crowds stop cheerin' and they passin' dirty looks?I now understand that I'll never be understood

Kendrick Lamar Dont Understand Lyrics
His eyes bloodshot redI watched him as he took a fifth of Henny to the head in memory of his brotherReminiscin' on them playing Sega with each otherHe was hurtin', I could see it, plenty tears, no KleenexI stood by his side because that was my homieGave him a hug, some of his brother's blood got on meClinchin' his fist on some angry shitStood up, sat back down on the curb and asked me who they be hangin' withI wasn't sure, so I gave him no answerBut I was sure that he had him a blammer and wanted warRevenge, what do you say to a good friendThat just lost it and grabbin' choppers out of the closet?I tried my best to make him re-negBut he was like, "My nig, this feelin' is more than personal"I stood downHe hopped in a four-door Honda AccordBefore he bent the block, he said, "K-Dot..."...You wouldn't understand"Or, at least, try to understand
