I'm in shockThe nerve, the audacityOkaySo if you rebuke me for workin' with someone else on a couple of VsWhat do you really think of the nigga that's makin' your beats?I've done things for him I thought that he never would needFather had to stretch his hands out and get it from meI pop style for 30 hours then let him repeatNow you poppin' up with the jokes, I'm dead, I'm asleepI just left from over by y'all puttin' pen to the sheetsTired of sittin' quiet and helpin' my enemies eatKeep gettin' temperature checksThey know that my head overheatsDon't know why the fuck you niggas listen to Denim or SteveMust've had your Infrared wrong, now your head in the beamY'all are the spittin' image of whatever jealousy breedsDon't push me when I'm in album modeYou're not even top 5 as far as your label talent goesYou send shots, well I got to challenge thoseBut I bring Calicos to the AlamoI could never have a Virgil in my circleAnd hold him back 'cause he makes me nervousI wanna see my brothers flourish to they higher purposeYou niggas leeches and serpentsI think it's good that now the teachers are learnin', yeahYour brother said it was your cousin, then him, then youSo, you don't rap what you did, you just rap what you knewDon't be ashamed, it's plenty niggas that do what you doThere's no malice in your heart, you're an approachable dudeMan, you might've sold to college kids for Nike and MercedesBut you act like you sold drugs for Escobar in the '80sI had a microphone of yours, but then the signature fadedI think that pretty much resembles what's been happenin' latelyPlease believe your demise will be televised, yeahAnd as for Q, man, I changed his life a couple timesNigga was at Kroger workin' double timeY'all actin' like he made the boy when I was tryna help the guyYeah, who gassed you to play with me?Man, you made this shit as easy as ABCsWhoever supposedly makin' me hitsBut then got no hits sound like they need meMy hooks did it, my lyrics did itMy spirit did it, I'm fearless with it, yeahI really shouldn't have given you none of my time'Cause you older than the nigga you runnin' behindLook, holla at me when you multi-millionI told you keep playin' with my nameAnd I'ma let it ring on you like Virginia WilliamsI'm too resilient, get out your feelingsIt's gonna be a cruel summer for youI told Weezy and Baby, "I'ma done him for you"Tell 'Ye we got a invoice comin' to youConsiderin' that we just sold another 20 for you

Drake Lose You Lyrics
I don't care what society thinks. They're nothing anyway. They're no better than me. Out there you just have to fit into a pattern that somebody's already laid out for you. Life we live, you have to set your own patterns, your own ideals. You have to handle the whole job yourself. No snow tires, the Range slip-slide like Trick Daddy and TrinaOli North pull in, like, 10 million a seasonQueen Street visions that nobody believed inIf we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin'Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to WeekndThe city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'Not when everybody out here beefin'We got it, now we just gotta keep itAmerica's most wanted, man, I'm still on the runAll these number ones and we still not the onesNo hard feelings, but I'll still get you spunWent and got diplomas and we still goin' dumbPlease never label niggas who lay down for a livin'My competition, it's beyond offensiveI'm in it for the glory, not the honor mentionNot tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distanceYeah, distance, I'm on a different missionThis the remix to "Ignition," hot and fresh out the kitchenHow you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?Too overly ambitious, too late to fix itToo late for condolences when it's over withI need to start sayin' shit when I notice itBe open with people I need some closure withBe honest with myself and take ownershipOpinions started to burn when tables started to turnI really used to feel like they loved a nigga at firstExcitin' times, revitalizedTrust this little light of mine is gonna shine positivelyI'm just takin' what God will give meGrateful like Jerry, Bob and MickeyBetter attitude, we'll see where it gets meI know catchin' flies with honey is still stickyI wrote the book on world-class finessesAnd tasteful gestures and makin' effortsAnd never placin' secondAnd even better knowin' you're first but then takin' secondInspirin' and never takin' creditI know I deserve more, I just never said itTwo middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah

Drake Make Me Proud Lyrics
I like a woman with a future and a pastA little attitude problem all good, it'll make the shit lastDon't make it too easy, girl, don't take it too fastYeah, that's it right there, that's it, do it just like thatOnly you can do it just like thatAnd I love it when your hair still wet 'cause you just took a showerRunning on a treadmill and only eating saladSound so smart like you graduated collegeLike you went to Yale, but you probably went to Howard, knowing youWeekend in Miami, tryna study by the poolCouple things due, but you always get it doneMight've been a time where I loved her tooBut you take that away and you've always been the one, oneI wonder why the moon looks nice, girlMaybe it's just right for the nightYou said niggas coming on too strong, girlThey want you in they life as a wifeThat's why you wanna have no sex, why you wanna protestWhy you wanna fight for your right'Cause you don't love them boysPussy run everything, fuck that noiseI know things get hard, but girl, you got it, girl, you got it, there you goCan't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?Wonderin' what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fineWhen all these motherfuckers wanna waste your timeIt's just amazing, girl, and all I can say is

Drake You And The 6 Lyrics
Rider shitHaving conversations with mama, man, my life is a messAin't been returning the texts, so she been reading the pressShe got Google Alerts, them shits go straight to her phoneShe worry 'bout me from home, you know she raised me aloneShe said, "I heard you back with you know who"I told her, "girl, I'm always back with you know who," yeahAnd she like, "Who are we kidding? You're 27, you're just being youYou're your father's child, man, thank God you got some me in you"At least I always, at least I always see it throughAt least I'm always being true to what you taught meRetired teacher, but your words still got me evolvin'Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solvin'And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriendsAnd assistants always convinced that there's someone betterLike that girl from your gym who trains youI know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free ThursdayAnd I'm sure that she's an angel, but she don't want this lifeThe timing ain't rightMaybe one day, but even one day with us is the time of her lifeWe do things that people pay to documentYou got the sweetest heartBut I'm not here to give out complimentsOr boost nobody's confidence, mommaI got no friends in this, mommaI don't pretend with this, mommaI'on joke with this, mommaI pull the knife out my back and I cut they throat with it, mommaI'm Game of Thrones with it, mommaI'm Home Alone with it, mommaI'm t-I really hate using this tone with you, mommaI really hate gettin' aggressive on this phone with you, mommaI really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two, mommaIt's just they cloning me, mommaThem niggas wannabes, mommaIts like - I'm the one they wanna be, mommaI just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable, mommaI mean I kill 'em every time they do a song with me, mommaI sing a hook they sing along with me, mommaWhat more they want  from me, momma?Yeah, this is a crazy lifeBut you and the six raised me right"Don't ever take advice," that was great advice

Yeah AyyLookI wish everyone could tell me exactly what they need from meThe first second they speak to me, I'm not with all the secrecySecretly beefin' me behind closed doorsBut playin' it peacefully for the streets to seeMy nigga, have some decencyDon't move like a putoCould at least keep it a buck like AntetokounmpoI made north of the border like Vito RizzutoThrowin' parties in Miami, they lovin' us muchoWith the ho ratio, I'm like David CarusoThеre's a mad shortage of peoplе givin' me kudosI been doin' this since T-Pain was pourin' us NuvoYou tell 'em I run the country, they'll say, "True, though"Papi chulo, grippin' culoAnd I got the flows niggas steal like boot toesYou boys reachin' new lowsLettin' me take the rap for that Casper the Ghost shitWhile you findin' all of the loopholesYou niggas move too coldSee the watch collection and assume I got time'Cause of the ruby rose two-toneOr switch it to the one I call "R.I.P. Nipsey"'Cause I swear to God the bezel got sixty of them blue stonesMaybe I'm gettin' too stonedCalacatta marble for my tombstoneHere lies a nigga that never lied in his new songOr any of his old songsThey sing them shits like folk songsKumbaya, boom-ba-yeKnow the owl stay on meBad bitches tryna come through and lay on meTryna get the earl grey on meBut I ain't really into talkin' namesOnly tee you're getting from me is one for the walk of shameHeart is on my sleeve and my body is in the hall of fameHigh fashion and my life is full of climaxesAnd my wishes come true without blowin' eyelashesUp in 'Bron crib, fishbowl wineglassesThat's how we passin' timeHundred thousand on the lineAt the table prayin' banker shows a natural nineIt never happens half the timeMy losing nights are still a vibeThat's the things I acceptYou over there in denial, we not neck and neckIt's been a lot of years since we seen you comin' correctMan, fuck a "Respectfully," I just want my respectThey tried to label me mean, I say what I meanPeople that could've stayed on the teamThey played in-betweenClouds is hanging over you now, 'cause I'm reigning supremeSome of these niggas say what they mean, it ain't what it seemsHad to pull my niggas out the mud like I'm trainin' MarinesYou niggas hot to them little kids, you ain't famous to meTold you I'm aimin' straight for the head, not aiming to pleaseI could give a fuck about who designing your sneakers and teesHave somebody put you on a Gildan, you play with my seedTrust me, there's some shit you really gotta come see to believeThat's why your people not believers, they all leavin' yaThat's why you buyin' into the hype that the press feedin' yaYou know the fourth level of jealousy is called mediaIsn't that an ironic revelation?Give that address to your driver, make it your destination'Stead of just a post out of desperationThis me reachin' the deepest state of my meditationWhile you over there tryna impress the nationMind's runnin' wild with the speculationWhy the fuck we peacemakin', doin' the explanationsIf we just gon' be right back in that bitch without hesitation?But let me digress on behalf of the associationI'll play it cool with you, then mark a nigga like CopenhagenSee, they gettin' loose with the line like open cagesIn the La Ferrari, my emotions racin', dancin' out a condo, ocean bathin'Niggas textin' "Bro," but we are not of no close relationI was down to give these niggas credit, but hold the paymentSomehow I'm the greatest in the game, to my own amazementThe greatest in the world, there's no debatin'You boys 'bout to wheel me to defeat like we rollerbladin'Far as the Drake era, man, we in the golden agesLook at the total wagesAnd look at the heroes fallin' from grace in their older agesIf we talkin' top three, then you been slidin' to third like stolen basesToss around Rollies with frozen facesThey used to tell me back in the day, "Boy, you're going places"Never understood where I could really take it

Drake When To Say When Lyrics
YeahSomebody, umSomebody hit me today and they were like"Nah, just make sure, you knowYou tell me what to do when I get there, you know?"I said, "I respect it, no problem"I got all these blessings just to give it to others anywayKnow what I'm sayin'?Yeah, my hand's always open, for realAyyThirty-three years, I gave that to the gameThirty-three mil', I'll save that for the rainFive hundred weeks, I'll fill the charts with my painFive hundred mil' and I'll fall back in the 6ixFinally give you niggas the space you need to existMichael Jackson shit, but the palace is not for kidsStill women sayin' it's childish, the way we liveBrought a few Ws to the 6ixBaby mama fluke, but I love her for who she isBaby, Wayne and Tez responsible for this shitHalf the time, I question my consciousness in this shitOther times, I question if compliments are legitFull-time, I'm out here confident as a bitchTryna make good on the promises that I giveTryna make sure my accomplices are legitRegister the business in my brother's nameThirty-five hunnid in her pocket, that should cover thingsCertified lover man, trappin' out the motherlandAlways move right so my watch is on the other handShe can try and play it down now, but she was a fanPeople wanna know what's in my pockets, they don't understandMy assistant always findin' Percocet and rubber bandsKnow my mom might not want to hear how I discover plansWord to Sandra Graham, no one love you like your mother canI watched Michael Rubin win a million off a couple handsI decide what to see next like it's on demandI decide what to be next like I'm switchin' plansI'ma tell you what you feel next like the weathermanI will split heads and break necks for my little man6 God, prayin' hands like I'm a religious manBut I'm just a sicker man, wicked manLook, we can argue back and forth, but who's the richer man?Isn't that what matters in this world that we livin' in?Bang those dividends, snakes stay slitherin'How you plan to make it to the top by just fittin' in?How you plan to take a nigga's spot by just givin' in?How you gon' treat this shit like you gon' get to live again?How you gettin' hype off one hit? Do that shit againHow you got a manager you mad at after you got the win?Bet you got some niggas that'll love you 'til the bitter endBet you got somebody that's just smarter than your other friendsGive 'em a percentage, see what happens to your blessings thenYou just need to stay close to your people that was there when others could've beenThere when others should've beenGot a nigga starin' at the game like, "Damn, coach, put him in"But you never listen, so you niggas goin' wood againGot us in the crib, talkin' 'bout what niggas coulda been, shoulda beenAnd I got your girl on the second floor, beggin' me to put it inAnd it's not because all of the money that you wouldn't spendAnd it's not because I set it up to try and get revengeIt's because you niggas insecure, you ain't made menIt's because even though you hate on me, we stay friendsIt's because you niggas never learn when to say whenYeah

Drake Is There More Lyrics
Only holdin' up I do is my end of the bargainOnly beggin' that I do is me beggin' your pardonOnly tryin' that I do is me tryin' the hardestOnly problems I do are math problems with profitOnly lyin' I do is lyin' out in the tropicsOnly cryin' I do is cryin' from laughin' 'bout itOnly lackin' I can do is my lack of responsesOnly rest that I do is "Where the rest of my commas?"Still I rise, Maya Angelou vibesWhen life comin' at you from all angles and sidesAnd they don't wanna see that you smilin' from insideIt really boils down to how you plan to surviveLove certain ones but never get attached to 'emGive 'em nice things, but what's that to 'em?Especially when another girl I flew in is flickin' up in my bathroomAnd they recognize the bathroomAll hell starts to break loose in my textsI only tell lies to who I gotta protectI would rather have you remember me how we metI would rather lose my leg than lose their respectBut that'll never happen the way I'm watchin' my stepThat ain't what I'm 'boutI'm in control of my destiny, never in doubtIf I can't make it with you, I'll make it withoutThey say take the good with the bad, I'll take it withoutHouston women I wine-and-dine and take to the houseMy moral compass is janky, it breaks in the SouthIs there more to life than digits and bankin' accounts?Is there more to life than sayin' I figured it out?Is there more? Yeah

Drake Paris Morton Music Lyrics
Would've came back for you, I just needed timeTo do what I had to do, caught in the lifeI can't let it goWhether that's right, I will never know, oh-oh-ohHope you forgive me, never meant wrongTried to be patient but waited too longBut I would've came back, but I would've came back for youWould've came back, would've came backI talk slicker than a pimp from AugustaWho just had his linen suit dry-cleanedBitches, what's up with ya?I hate calling the women "bitches," but the bitches love itI took some sense and made a nickel of itI'm urging all daughters to kiss their mothersWith those lips that all that lipstick coversYou're never too grown up to miss and hug herAnd girls counting on me to be there like missing rubbersI'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant loversThis ain't the life that I'm used toReintroduced to people I've been introduced toDid you forget me?Or are you too scared to tell me that you met meAnd fear that I won't remember?I wish you could still accept me for meI miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dadThe simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners haveI'm halfway across the world with dozens of bagsFeeling like all four members of Color Me BaddIn one nigga, amazing shitI got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shitI don't drink every bottle I own, I be aging shitAnd I got them wedding ring flows, that engaging shitWhich one of y'all got fleets on your keychains?The seats for these Heat games?I really think that you stare at yourself and you see thingsLa Familia, I've been inducted and instructedTo stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck with, fuck is up?Having lunch and debating Ferrari prices23 and going through a midlife crisisBut trust me, I still deliver like a midwifeAnd no, I'm not saying I'm the nicest, I just live life like itUh, it take a certain type of man to teachTo be far from hood, but to understand the streetsI never threw away that paper with my Grammy speechBecause I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reachYeah, you gotta own it if you want itKisses all on her body, she tells me live in the momentAnd, baby, I'll never forget none of thatGirl, I told you I was coming back, I
